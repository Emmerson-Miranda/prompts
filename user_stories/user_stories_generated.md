# High-Level User Stories for Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

## **Introduction**
This document contains high-level user stories derived from the requirements analysis for the Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application project. Each story follows the Cucumber format and adheres to SCRUM guidelines. These user stories represent both functional and non-functional requirements and are intended to provide a structured framework for software developers to implement the application incrementally.
