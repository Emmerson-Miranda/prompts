Experimental AI prompts

## GitHub Models playground

You can now use the `user prompt improvement` it helps transform vague or broad prompts into clearer, more specific, and optimized ones for better model outputs. You can refine prompts to improve clarity, add focus, or adjust tone and style to match your needs.

[Go to GitHub Models playground](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o/playground)
